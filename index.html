    The Krell were an advanced alien race who built a vast underground computer
    complex on a planet called Altair IV, powered by thermonuclear reactors. The
    machines were so reliable and self-sufficient that they continued to function 
    thousands of years after the Krell had left behind their corporeal existence.
